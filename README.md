This has been made to serve as the front-end display and backend unit for a hardware Medical Kiosk developed for doctor booking system in hilly regions of Himachal Pradesh (SIH Problem Statement by Ministry of Himachal Pradesh in 2023).

Key Features:
  Recognises the voice of the user for hindi language (majorly spoken in Himachal Pradesh).
  The user can brief their symtoms in their native language and still have an appointment booked for them, and appointment details will be sent to the user. 
  It will also be read to the user on spot in their native language.
  This is done due to the less signal reception and scarce 
  Books an appointment based on the symptom of the user detected from their voice.
  Involves voice recognition, tokenizing, NLP to find symptoms and searches the nearest doctor who specializes with the disease involved with the symptoms.

The above image shows the architecture of the whole system.
The above uploaded project files just involve the frontend and the backend using python for the project.
